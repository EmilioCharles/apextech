Adding Data Analysis and SEO transforms your agency from a "creative shop" into a full-stack "Growth & Intelligence Engine." This is highly attractive to B2B clients and Founders who need ROI, not just pretty designs.

Here is the updated 2.0 Blueprint incorporating these services, ensuring the UI remains clean while communicating the depth of your offer.

1. Updated Strategy: "The Data-Driven Growth Loop"

We need to group your massive list of services so it doesn't look like a cheesecake factory menu. We will categorize them into three logical pillars on the site:

Build (Product): Web Dev, SaaS, Branding, Design.

Scale (Visibility): Digital Marketing, SEO, Automations.

Optimize (Intelligence): AI, Data Analysis, Operations.

2. The Updated "Bento Grid" (Visual Layout)

The "Services" section is the most critical part of the UI. Since we added two complex services, we will update the Bento Grid layout to a 3x2 Asymmetrical Grid.

Card 1 (Large - Vertical): The Engineering Core

Services: Web Development, SaaS, App Build.

Visual: A floating 3D laptop showing code compiling.

Micro-copy: "Enterprise-grade builds."

Card 2 (Medium - Horizontal): The Growth Engine

Services: SEO, Digital Marketing.

Visual: An animated line graph going up + a Google Search "Top Rank" badge.

Micro-copy: "Dominate search. Capture leads."

Card 3 (Small - Square): The Intelligence Hub

Services: Data Analysis.

Visual: A dark-mode pie chart that spins and reveals percentages on hover.

Micro-copy: "Decisions backed by math."

Card 4 (Medium - Horizontal): The Automation Suite

Services: AI, Automations, Workflows.

Visual: Nodes connecting (like a Zapier/Make workflow).

Micro-copy: "Automate the boring stuff."

Card 5 (Small - Square): The Brand Soul

Services: Branding & Design.

Visual: Kinetic typography (moving text).

Micro-copy: "Visuals that stick."

3. Copywriting Updates (Integrating Data & SEO)

Updated Hero Sub-Headline:

"From high-performance Web Development to AI-driven Data Intelligence. We build, rank, and automate businesses for the future."

New Section: "The Intelligence Layer"
(Place this right after the Case Studies to validate your results)

Headline: "We Don't Guess. We Analyze."

Layout: A split feature row.

Left Side (SEO): "Organic Dominance. It’s not just keywords; it’s about technical architecture. We build your site to be loved by Google from Day 1."

Right Side (Data): "Business Intelligence. We turn your raw data into actionable dashboards. Know your CAC, LTV, and churn in real-time."

4. Special Features for the New Services

Since you are targeting B2B and Founders, you need to show competence in these specific areas immediately.

The "Free Audit" Hook (SEO Specific)

In your "Book a Call" section, add a dynamic toggle:

Option A: "General Inquiry"

Option B: "Free SEO/Site Audit"

Logic: If they select Option B, asking for their URL is mandatory. This is a massive lead magnet for SMBs.

The "Live Data" Visual (Data Analysis Specific)

On the homepage, include a "Live Dashboard" Component.

Visual: A small section that looks like a SaaS dashboard. It animates numbers counting up (e.g., "Revenue Generated for Clients: $10M+", "Leads Captured: 50k+").

Why: It subconsciously proves you are good at Data Analysis and UI Design simultaneously.

5. Updated Navigation Bar (The "Mega Menu")

Because you have ~8 distinct services now, a simple dropdown isn't enough. Use a Glass-panel Mega Menu:

Menu Item: Services (Hover triggers full-width panel)

Column 1: Create

Web Development

SaaS & Web Apps

Branding & Design

Column 2: Grow

SEO & Visibility (New)

Digital Marketing

Column 3: Automate

AI Solutions

Data Analysis & BI (New)

Workflow Automation

6. The "Call to Action" Logic Refinement

Your contact form needs to route leads intelligently based on these new services.

The Form Logic (Typeform/Tally style):

"What is your primary focus right now?"

Options: Build a Product, Get More Leads (SEO/Ads), Save Time (AI/Auto), Understand My Data.

"If Data/SEO selected:"

Ask: "Do you have existing data or a website we should look at?"

"Booking:"

Result: "Based on your needs, you'll be meeting with [Name], our Head of [Relevant Department]."

This makes the user feel like they are getting a specialized consultation, not a generic sales call.
